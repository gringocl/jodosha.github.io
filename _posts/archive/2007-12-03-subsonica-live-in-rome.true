<p><a href="http://www.subsonica.it" title="Subsonica">Subsonica</a> is one of my favourite band. It&#8217;s a Torino based pop electronic quintet, that just turned 10 years of activity.</p>
<p>They just posted a video of their recent dig in Rome. I was there, near the stage. Great experience!!</p>
