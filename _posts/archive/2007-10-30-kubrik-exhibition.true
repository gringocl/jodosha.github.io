<p>Sunday I went to a <strong>Stanley Kubrik</strong> exhibition in Rome. He is one of my favourite directors.</p>
<p>The exhibition is full of screenplays, shots and things regarding his movies. It was very exciting!!</p>
<p>If you are in <strong>Rome</strong> you can visit <a href="http://www.palazzoesposizioni.it/">Palazzo delle Esposizioni</a> until the Jan 6th, 2008.</p>
